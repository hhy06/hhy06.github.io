You can replace your old dictionary with a defaultdict:

>>> from collections import defaultdict
>>> d = {'foo': 123, 'bar': 456}
>>> d['baz']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'baz'
>>> d = defaultdict(lambda: -1, d)
>>> d['baz']
-1
The "trick" here is that a defaultdict can be initialized with another dict. This means that you preserve the existing values in your normal dict:

>>> d['foo']
123

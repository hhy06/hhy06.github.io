So Inoreader is not letting you add any more subscriptions once you hit the 150 ceiling.

Are you docilly deleting those half dead RSSs to make room for new ones?

Once you are below 150, you can again start subscribing way any amount of RSSs using the following trick:

1. Instead of directly subscribing in Inoreader, you create OPML lists of subscriptions (using another Inoreader account, subscribe and export, or directly editing a txt file) 
    Note: make sure the list contains no more than 150 entries.
2. Store the XML file somewhere on-line (e.g. in GitHub) 
3. In Inoreader, select PREFERENCES -> OPML subscriptions -> add the URL of the OPML list.

Now you can have as many as 150+150*#lists subscriptions! Enjoy.

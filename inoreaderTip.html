How to circumvent Inoreader's restriction of 150 subscriptions for free accounts</h1>
    
<p>    So Inoreader is not letting you add any more subscriptions once you hit the 150 ceiling.
</p><p>
Are you docilly deleting those half dead RSSs to make room for new ones?
</p><p>
Once you are below 150, you can again start subscribing way any amount of RSSs using the following trick:
</p><p>
1. Instead of directly subscribing in Inoreader, you create OPML lists of subscriptions (using another Inoreader account, subscribe and export, or directly editing a txt file) 
    Note: make sure the list contains no more than 150 entries.
    </p><p>
2. Store the XML file somewhere on-line (e.g. in GitHub) </p><p>
3. In Inoreader, select PREFERENCES -> OPML subscriptions -> add the URL of the OPML list.
</p><p>
Now you can have as many as 150+150*#lists subscriptions! Enjoy.

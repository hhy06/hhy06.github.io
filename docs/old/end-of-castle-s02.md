Such a sad thing! We all want Rich and Kate together, of course. Seeing Kate with that robbery detective is almost painful, and what a relief it was that in the end she dumped him! But Castle got together with an ex-wife... what a Deus ex machina (?)

We could almost predict what happens in the beginning of s03. Castle will come back to the police station and after zero or a few episodes break up with the ex. Kate will be cold to him in the beginning but things will begin to heat up towards mid season.

The only real question is, when will they, officially, be together?

### This file tests the availability of MD interpretation 


*MD* stands for MarkDown, I suppose. 

As _opposed_ to MarkUp language.

Q:

1. I wonder how i can have latex support? 

It would be a shame if my blog end up with no latex.... Let's see how the following code works:

	`
	Let $\lambda $ be a partion of $n \geq 1$: 
	\[ \lambda = (l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_n) \]
	`

Result: 

Let $\lambda $ be a partion of $n \geq 1$: 
\[ \lambda = (l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_n) \]

As a half-full person, I am glad to see the $n\geq 1$  part works.


$\alpha \over1 \frac{1}{2}$
 $\lamda \int_3^4 \sin(x)$

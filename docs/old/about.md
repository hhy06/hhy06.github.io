	> Combinatorial we stand, discrete we fall!
Notes on the stand-fall statement:

It is universally acknowledged that we stand when united, and fall when divided. 

Observe that the word ''combinatorial'' and  ''united'' are almost synnonyms. The same goes for ''divided'' and ''discrete''.

There was a time when I couldn't tell discrete and discreet apart. Considering that discrete mathematicians should communicate and not keep things to themselves, we might also say that 

> Discrete we stand, discreet we fall.

I saw an interesting article in the nov. 22 issue of Newsweek on the modernization of the city of Medellin in Columbia. I have never heard of this place before in my life.
It turns out that this town is on the mountains and a  `gondola` system plays a vital role in local transportation. This reminds me of Chongqing.
Decades ago this town is infested with drug lords and gangs. After the crack down of Escobar, a competent former-mathematician mayor started new policies that heavily involves local community in decision making. Since then there have been much progress in education and transportation.
Now this city has the lowest crime rate in south America.

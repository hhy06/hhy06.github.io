I tried syncing with CAM-PC and soon everything vanished in the gridea system there (probably due to syncing problems with nutbox) and the problem was then synced to my x1c...

Lucky I have a backup! Delte everything in the users\john\gridea folder to purge this plague. Then bring back your former life from the backup.

# The thing is:
If you add a new file to any of the gridea folders, the program breaks down and give you a no-data clean plate. I don't know why.

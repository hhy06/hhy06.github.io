According to Lascoux:

```
The 6 vertex model is supposed to tell something about ice, though not of the kind used in cold drinks. One has a planar array filled with water molecules having 6 possible types of orientation. One chooses 6 functions of the two coordinates. Each molecule is weighted by one these functions, according to its type. The weight of a given ‘square ice’ is the product of the weights of the molecules composing it.

# 905_what a month

I forgot almost all about this project until today. The company moved and my server is currently down (maybe I sent a poweroff command to it remotely yesterday, my memory is not clear now.)

Anyway I still have a git version in my laptop and maybe i can try updating from here. Viva mkdocs!

A word about the workflow. Though this project is built by mkdocs, and I have a local installation, I do not really need to run it locally every time I update. Simply edit the .md files and push to remote and github does the updating automatically. Like magic.

# what a month

I forgot almost all about this project until today. The company moved and my server is currently down (maybe I sent a poweroff command to it remotely yesterday, my memory is not clear now.)

Anyway I still have a git version in my laptop and maybe i can try updating from here. Viva mkdocs!

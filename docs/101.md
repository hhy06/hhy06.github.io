# This is such an excellent day!

My bike has had a flat tire for weeks. It stood morbid under the company building, lopsided and rusted. 

I have always wanted to change its tire. Finally after the company summit meet and the new department began to run somehow smoothly on its rails, I bought the tires online and got onto it. 

I bought a new tire. I also bought a tire-fix pack. I also bought several pry-bars because I heard they protect the tire from being punctured during the changing process. 

However when the tire and the fix-pack arrived each came with two extra prybars. 

I spent an hour in the hot noon and finally it was done. Getting the outer tire off and on was certainly hard, but within expectation. It was putting the wheel back on that really broke my back. 

After everything is back, I noticed the gear-changing was not very smooth. I changed the gear back and forth several times but the problem did not go away.

Anyway, I was too tired to deal with it. The old tire had a tiny hole. In fact it was possible to fix it with the sticker in the fix-pack, but I didn't.
